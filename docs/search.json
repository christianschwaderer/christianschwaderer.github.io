Dingler, and Martin Senn, examines government press conferences on COVID-19 to analyze communication behavior during crises. The pandemic provided a unique opportunity to explore political crisis communication through the lens of government messaging.\nFor more information, visit the project website.\n\n\nProject Objectives\nWe address two central questions: 1. Which strategies did governments and heads of state employ during the initial phase of the COVID-19 crisis? 2. What factors influenced these crisis communication strategies?\n\n\nProject Realization\nBy analyzing live-streamed speeches and press conferences from January to summer 2020 across 17 OECD countries, we aim to uncover how often and on what topics leaders communicated. Our findings will offer new insights into the political dimensions of the COVID-19 crisis and enhance our understanding of crisis communication strategies."
