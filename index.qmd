## Hi, I'm Christian Schwaderer

I am a **doctoral candidate** at the Department of Political Science, University of Innsbruck.

My research focuses on **political communication during crises**, with a particular emphasis on how the public perceives and reacts to government messaging. I investigate how communication evolves on social media platforms, delving into user interactions and responses.

I use **computational methods** such as text analysis, **natural language processing (NLP)**, and **text-as-data** approaches to analyze large-scale datasets, uncovering patterns in **political crisis discourse**.
